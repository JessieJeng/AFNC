Description: Performs the adaptive false negative control (AFNC), as descripted in Jeng et al. (2016).  The AFNC can provide informative analysis of very high-dimensional datasets with weak signals, such as in the analysis of large-scale sequencing studies at the single locus level, by including a large proportion of signals with high confidence.  The proportion of signals is estimated adaptively from the data.
